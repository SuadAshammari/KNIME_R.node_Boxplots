 This repository contains the KNIME workflow that has two nodes. The first is the file reader that includes the data frame, and the second is the R node (R view (table)), which contains the R script used to create a list of boxplots.

## How To Use The Workflow:
* ** File reader:** in this node, add the data set.
* ** R view (table):** this node will create the boxplot figures when it is executed. If there is overlap, click on configure > Image settings> then change the width and height to change the figures' dimensions.
